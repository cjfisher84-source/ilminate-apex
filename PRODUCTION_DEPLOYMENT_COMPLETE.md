## üîó Production API Endpoint

```
https://7bdfwnsqfj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/map
```

### ‚úÖ Test Successful!
```bash
curl -X POST "https://7bdfwnsqfj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/map" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Phishing email with fake DocuSign link. Powershell -EncodedCommand detected"}'
```

**Result**: Detected `T1566` (Phishing), `T1059.001` (PowerShell), `T1566.002` (Spearphishing Link) ‚úÖ

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  FINAL STEP REQUIRED: Add Environment Variable to AWS Amplify

The Lambda is deployed and working, but you need to add the API URL to your Amplify environment variables so the frontend can use it.

### **Option 1: AWS Console (Recommended)**

1. Go to **AWS Amplify Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Select your app: **ilminate-apex** or **apex.ilminate.com**
3. Click **Environment variables** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Manage variables**
5. Add new variable:
   - **Variable name**: `ATTACK_MAPPER_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://7bdfwnsqfj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/map`
6. Click **Save**
7. Wait for Amplify to rebuild (automatic)

### **Option 2: AWS CLI**

If you know your Amplify App ID:

```bash
# Find your app ID
aws amplify list-apps

# Add environment variable (replace <APP_ID>)
aws amplify update-app --app-id <APP_ID> \
  --environment-variables ATTACK_MAPPER_URL=https://7bdfwnsqfj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/map
```

---

## üìä What Will Happen After Adding the Env Var

Once the environment variable is added and Amplify rebuilds:

1. ‚úÖ `/reports/attack` page will be accessible at **https://apex.ilminate.com/reports/attack**
2. ‚úÖ ATT&CK matrix will render with real detection data
3. ‚úÖ Mapper API will work through Next.js proxy
4. ‚úÖ Security events can be mapped to techniques in real-time

### Until Then:
- ‚úÖ Page will load but show mock data (from `/api/attack/layer`)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Mapper API will return "ATTACK_MAPPER_URL not configured" (graceful fallback)
- ‚úÖ No errors, everything else works normally

---

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### Test the UI
```bash
open https://apex.ilminate.com/reports/attack
```

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ ATT&CK matrix renders
- ‚úÖ Top 10 techniques list
- ‚úÖ Clickable techniques
- ‚úÖ No console errors

### Test the Mapper API (via Next.js proxy)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://apex.ilminate.com/api/attack/map" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"mimikatz lsass.dmp detected"}'
```

**Expected**: Returns `T1003` (Credential Dumping)

## üí∞ AWS Cost Estimate

**Lambda**:
- First 1M requests/month: FREE
- After: $0.20 per 1M requests
- Compute: $0.0000133 per GB-second (512MB = $0.0000067/invocation)

**API Gateway**:
- First 1M requests/month: FREE
- After: $3.50 per 1M requests

**S3 Storage**:
- 38 MB MITRE data: ~$0.001/month (negligible)

**Estimated monthly cost**: < $1 for typical usage üí∞

---

## üîß Maintenance

### Update MITRE ATT&CK Data (Monthly)
```bash
cd ilminate-attack
./scripts/fetch_attack_data.sh
```

### Update Lambda Code
```bash
cd ilminate-attack/lambda/attack_mapper
# Edit app.py or rules.py
./bootstrap.sh  # Redeploy
```

### Add New Detection Rules
Edit `ilminate-attack/lambda/attack_mapper/rules.py`:
```python
(re.compile(r"your-pattern", re.I), "T1234", "Tactic", 0.8, "Rule: description")
```

Then redeploy the Lambda.

   - Monitor API Gateway metrics
   - Watch for errors in production

4. **Optimize** (Optional, later)
   - Add caching to Lambda (reduce S3 reads)
   - Wire `/api/attack/layer` to real DynamoDB/Athena data
   - Add confidence threshold filter in UI
   - Implement analyst override capabilities
