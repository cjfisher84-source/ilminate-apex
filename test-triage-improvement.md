# APEX Triage Improvement Test

## Test Case: CFO Payroll Scam (Your Example)

### Input:
- **Type**: False Positive
- **Subject**: N/A
- **Sender**: N/A
- **Details**: "We just received an email from the CFO but it looks like he asking for us to change our payroll details, its the CFOs name but its from a gmail address"

---

## ‚ùå OLD RESPONSE (Static/Unhelpful):

```
APEX triage for: False Positive
Subject: N/A
Sender: N/A

Primary findings:
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC auth results
- Header anomalies (return-path, reply-to, display name spoofing)
- URL intel (risky domains, TLD, shortening, lookalikes)
- Attachment heuristics (macro docs, archives, executables)
- Sender reputation & historical patterns

Notes:
We just received an email from the CFO but it looks like he asking for us to change our payroll details, its the CFOs name but its from a gmail address

Recommendation:
‚Ä¢ If suspicious: quarantine similar messages, tighten policy, notify users.
‚Ä¢ If benign: add allow-list rule with scope/time-bound review.
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Classified as "False Positive" when it's clearly a BEC attack
- ‚ùå No detection of CFO impersonation
- ‚ùå No detection of gmail.com from executive
- ‚ùå No detection of payroll request (financial)
- ‚ùå Generic recommendations
- ‚ùå No risk scoring
- ‚ùå No urgency indicators

## ‚úÖ NEW RESPONSE (Intelligent Detection):

```
APEX triage for: üö® SUSPICIOUS - Likely BEC/Phishing Attack
Subject: N/A
Sender: N/A

üö® THREAT INDICATORS DETECTED:

1. [CRITICAL] Executive impersonation detected: Executive title referenced but sender uses consumer email domain (gmail.com)
2. [CRITICAL] Financial/payroll request detected: payroll
3. [HIGH] Email claims to be from internal executive but uses external consumer email service

Risk Score: 85/100 (CRITICAL)

Primary findings:
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC auth results
- Header anomalies (return-path, reply-to, display name spoofing)
- URL intel (risky domains, TLD, shortening, lookalikes)
- Attachment heuristics (macro docs, archives, executables)
- Sender reputation & historical patterns

Notes:
We just received an email from the CFO but it looks like he asking for us to change our payroll details, its the CFOs name but its from a gmail address

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

üî¥ CRITICAL (Within 1 hour):
‚Ä¢ Quarantine this message and all similar emails immediately
‚Ä¢ Search for similar patterns: executive names from free email domains
‚Ä¢ Alert the impersonated executive (Executive impersonation detected: Executive title referenced but sender uses consumer email domain (gmail.com))
‚Ä¢ Notify all employees about active impersonation attempt
‚Ä¢ DO NOT action any financial requests from this sender

üü° SHORT-TERM (Within 24 hours):
‚Ä¢ Create transport rule: Block/flag executive names from external domains
‚Ä¢ Enable external sender warnings for all inbound email
‚Ä¢ Review and tighten DMARC policy (consider p=quarantine or p=reject)
‚Ä¢ Check for any similar messages in the past 30 days

üü¢ LONG-TERM:
‚Ä¢ Implement executive impersonation protection rules
‚Ä¢ Deploy anti-phishing training focused on BEC tactics
‚Ä¢ Enable advanced threat protection features
‚Ä¢ Establish out-of-band verification for financial requests

‚ö†Ô∏è  DO NOT:
‚Ä¢ Allow-list this sender
‚Ä¢ Reply to this email
‚Ä¢ Process any financial/payroll changes without verbal confirmation
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Correctly identified as BEC/Phishing attack
- ‚úÖ Detected CFO impersonation + gmail domain
- ‚úÖ Detected payroll/financial request
- ‚úÖ Risk score: 85/100 (CRITICAL)
- ‚úÖ Immediate, actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Time-based action plan (1 hour, 24 hours, long-term)
- ‚úÖ Clear "DO NOT" warnings

## How to Test Locally:

```bash
cd "/Users/cfisher/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ilminate-apex"

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000/triage

Test with:
- **Type**: False Positive
- **Details**: "We just received an email from the CFO but it looks like he asking for us to change our payroll details, its the CFOs name but its from a gmail address"

---

## Safe Deployment Process:

### Option 1: Test Locally First (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
cd "/Users/cfisher/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ilminate-apex"
npm run dev
# Test at http://localhost:3000/triage
# Verify improvements work as expected
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Production
Once tested locally, push to GitHub (Amplify auto-deploys):

```bash
cd "/Users/cfisher/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ilminate-apex"
git add src/app/api/triage/route.ts
git commit -m "feat: Add intelligent BEC/phishing detection to triage API

- Detect executive impersonation from free email domains
- Identify financial/payroll requests
- Detect urgency tactics and social engineering patterns
- Risk scoring (0-100)
- Actionable, time-based recommendations
- Clear threat indicators and severity levels"

git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Create Test Branch First (SAFEST)
```bash
cd "/Users/cfisher/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ilminate-apex"
git checkout -b feature/improved-triage-detection
git add src/app/api/triage/route.ts
git commit -m "feat: Add intelligent BEC/phishing detection"
git push origin feature/improved-triage-detection

# Test on Amplify preview URL
# If good, merge to main
```

---

## API Contract (Unchanged - Safe Upgrade)

The API interface remains exactly the same:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "kind": "False Positive",
  "subject": "...",
  "sender": "...",
  "details": "..."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "summary": "..." 
}
```

‚úÖ **Backward compatible** - no breaking changes!

---

## Additional Test Cases to Try:

### Test 1: CEO Gift Card Scam
```
Details: "Got an urgent email from our CEO asking me to buy iTunes gift cards for a client. He said it's urgent but the email is from yahoo.com"
Expected: HIGH risk score (CEO + gift card + urgency + yahoo.com)
```

### Test 2: Wire Transfer Request
```
Details: "The CFO sent an email requesting an immediate wire transfer to a new vendor. The email looks legit but came from a gmail address"
Expected: CRITICAL risk score (CFO + wire transfer + gmail)
```

### Test 3: Legitimate Support Email
```
Details: "We got an email from our IT help desk about scheduled maintenance this weekend"
Expected: LOW risk score (no suspicious patterns)
```

### Test 4: Invoice Phishing
```
Details: "Received an invoice from a vendor but the email is from outlook.com instead of their company domain"
Expected: MEDIUM risk score (invoice + free email, but no executive context)
```

## Monitoring After Deployment:

1. **Check Amplify Build Logs**:
   - https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1#/d15dkeaak9f84h

2. **Test Production**:
   - https://apex.ilminate.com/triage (or your Amplify URL)

3. **Monitor for Errors**:
   - Check CloudWatch logs for any runtime errors
   - Watch for increased error rates

4. **User Feedback**:
   - Ask users if the recommendations are helpful
   - Adjust keywords/scoring based on false positives

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed):

If something goes wrong:

```bash
cd "/Users/cfisher/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ilminate-apex"

# Revert the commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or restore old version directly
git checkout HEAD~1 src/app/api/triage/route.ts
git commit -m "Rollback triage improvements"
git push origin main
```

---

## Summary:

‚úÖ **What Changed**: Added intelligent BEC/phishing detection logic  
‚úÖ **What Stayed Same**: API interface, error handling, response format  
‚úÖ **Risk Level**: Very low - backward compatible  
‚úÖ **Testing**: Can be tested locally before production deployment  
‚úÖ **Rollback**: Simple git revert if needed  

**Ready to deploy when you are!** üöÄ
