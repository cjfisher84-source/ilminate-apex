⚠️  WARNING: STAGING ONLY - DO NOT RUN WITHOUT APPROVAL ⚠️

This file is a reminder that the backfill script should ONLY be run:
1. In STAGING environments
2. After explicit sign-off
3. After taking backups/snapshots
4. With proper monitoring

To run later (STAGING ONLY, with approval):

TABLE=ILMINATE_EVENTS_STAGING \
MAPPER_PROXY="https://staging.apex.ilminate.com/api/attack/map" \
ts-node ilminate-attack/scripts/backfill_attack_mapping.ts

The script includes safety checks:
- Requires explicit TABLE and MAPPER_PROXY env vars
- Rejects any TABLE name containing "prod"
- Processes only first 1000 events by default
- Includes rate limiting (100ms between requests)
- Logs detailed progress and errors

Before running:
1. Take a DynamoDB backup or snapshot
2. Verify TABLE points to staging
3. Verify MAPPER_PROXY points to staging API
4. Get explicit approval from team lead
5. Monitor the process in real-time

Rollback plan:
- If issues occur, restore from backup
- Remove "techniques" attribute from affected items
- Check CloudWatch logs for errors
