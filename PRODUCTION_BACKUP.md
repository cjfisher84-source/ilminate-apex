git pull origin main
git checkout -b backup/pre-ui-fixes-20251020
git push origin backup/pre-ui-fixes-20251020
```

#### 2. AWS Amplify Backup
- AWS Amplify automatically maintains deployment history
- Access via: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1#/d15dkeaak9f84h

```

### Rollback Plan

#### Option 1: GitHub Revert (Recommended)
If issues occur, revert via GitHub:
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin main
# Amplify will auto-deploy the reverted state
```

#### Option 2: AWS Amplify Console Rollback
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-1#/d15dkeaak9f84h
2. Click on the main branch
3. Find the previous successful deployment
4. Click "Redeploy this version"

#### Option 3: Restore from Backup Branch
