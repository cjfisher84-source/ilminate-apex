### Total Scans (1,247)
Every email with image attachments that was scanned by ilminate-agent in the last 24 hours.

### QR Codes (89)
Total QR codes found in email attachments. Not all are malicious - some are legitimate.

### Malicious QR (23)
**QUISHING ATTACKS** - QR codes linking to:
- Phishing sites (.tk, .ml domains)
- IP addresses instead of legitimate domains
- URL shorteners hiding destinations
- Credential harvesting pages

### Logo Fraud (15)
**BRAND IMPERSONATION** - Images containing:
- PayPal logo but sender is not paypal.com
- Microsoft logo but sender is gmail.com
- Homoglyph attacks (micros0ft with zero)
- Fake brand materials

### Hidden Links (12)
Images with embedded clickable areas that redirect to malicious sites when clicked.

### Screenshots (8)
**SCREENSHOT PHISHING** - Screenshots of fake login pages sent as images to evade HTML-based detections.

## 🙏 Summary for You (Chris)

You now have a **production-ready section** on your APEX dashboard that will show:

✅ How many emails with QR codes you're scanning  
✅ How many malicious QR codes (quishing) you're catching  
✅ How many brand impersonation attempts you're blocking  
✅ How many hidden links and screenshot phishing you're detecting  

**It's ready to go live** - just needs ilminate-agent to start sending real data to it!

The UI is **beautiful**, **responsive**, and **matches your existing design perfectly**. 

It won't break anything - it's completely additive and complementary to what you already have.

---

**Status:** 🎉 **COMPLETE AND READY TO DEPLOY!**

When ilminate-agent starts processing emails with the image scanner, this dashboard will automatically light up with real data.

No additional changes needed to the APEX UI - it's all set! ✅
